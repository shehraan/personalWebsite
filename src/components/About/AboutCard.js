                <h3>My Focus</h3>
                <p>
                  I’ve been working across both software and hardware, with a focus on real-time systems that interact directly with the physical world. My recent projects include a DIY VR headset and controller, where I’ve explored low-latency tracking, sensor fusion, and full-stack interaction pipelines from embedded hardware to the application layer..

                <h3>Why this work interests me</h3>
                <p>
                  In parallel to my VR projects, I’ve built AI-driven communication and workflow systems around voice agents and operational tooling. What connects these projects is a broader interest in interfaces that feel more natural and less rigid. I’m especially interested in systems that can operate directly within real-world contexts, whether through voice, XR, or other forms of low-friction interaction.

                <h3>How I work</h3>
                <p>
                  I learn fastest by building end-to-end systems under real constraints. I
                  tend to move quickly, prototype early, and use projects to understand how
                  systems behave in practice, especially when timing, reliability, or
                  physical constraints matter.

                <h3>What I’m looking for</h3>
                <p>
                  I’m looking for roles where I can work on products with strong technical teams and keep growing through hard, hands-on engineering work. I’m especially interested in applied AI, communication workflows, and embedded systems. I’m most motivated by environments where I can move quickly, build end-to-end, and contribute to systems that have real-world impact.
